Task 6 – Password Strength Evaluation

Cyber Security Internship

 Objective

Create multiple passwords with different complexities, test them using online password strength checkers, and analyze the results to understand what makes a password strong.

Steps Performed

Created multiple passwords with variations in:

Length

Use of uppercase & lowercase

Numbers

Symbols

Evaluated each password using free online tools such as:

passwordmeter.com

other password strength analyzers

Recorded feedback including:

Strength score

Weaknesses

Suggested improvements

Researched password attacks, including:

Brute-force attacks

Dictionary attacks

Credential stuffing

Analyzed how complexity improves security and reduces attack success probability.

Key Learnings
What Makes a Password Strong?

Length of 12+ characters

Mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols

No dictionary words or predictable patterns

No reuse across multiple accounts

Common Password Attacks

Brute Force: Attempts every possible combination

Dictionary Attack: Uses wordlists to guess predictable passwords

Phishing: Tricks users into revealing passwords

Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked passwords from other platforms

 Best Practices Identified

Use a password manager

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Avoid personal information (DOB, names, etc.)

Use passphrases when possible (e.g., “BlueTigerRunsFast!29”)

Summary

Password complexity directly affects security.
Stronger passwords increase entropy, making them harder to crack even with automated tools.
By testing different password types, the importance of unpredictability and length becomes clear.
